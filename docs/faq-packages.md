What are the different types of packages and which one should I use?
</h3>

You may have heard of many package-related terms - managed packages, Package 2, Developer-controlled packages, DCPs, unlocked packages, locked packages, unmanaged packages, second-generation packages... Letâ€™s demystify these now. 


**First-Generation Packaging**

Before Salesforce DX came along, we had two types of packages:

 - Unmanaged packages used for one-time deployment of metadata.
 - Managed packages geared towards Salesforce partners that build and list apps on AppExchange.


**Second-Generation Packaging** (aka Packaging 2 or Salesforce DX Packaging)

With Salesforce DX, we are launching Packaging 2 or Second-Generation Packages. With Salesforce DX, we want packaging to work as well for customers as they do for partners.

Unlocked Packages are designed for customers and non-ISV partners (SIs and consultants).

Managed Second-generation packages (Managed 2GPs) are geared towards ISVs who want to develop and list apps on AppExchange. While Managed 2GPs are beta, there are certain key parity features (Push Upgrades, LMA, ability to list on AppExchange, patch versions, etc.) that are missing in them. So, if you are a Salesforce Partner, your best bet is to continue with First-Generation Managed Packages until we build those feature parity items in managed 2GPs.
